# Mouse Controls Brainstorm

## Feature Ideas for Mouse-Based Controls

### Proposed Control Scheme

**Select Mode:**
- `Space + Click` on ball → Control `ball_size`
- `Scroll` to adjust ball size

**Connect Mode:**
- `Command + Multi-click` → Control `connection_factor`
- `Scroll` to adjust connection factor

### Discussion
What do you think about moving the functionality to mouse controls?

This would provide a more intuitive interaction pattern for users.
